    <h1>My Dog Cassie</h1>

    <p>This is my dog, Cassie. Cassie is a mixture of Beagle and Jack Russell (although she has more Beagle in her).</p>
    
    <p>My family got Cassie for my sister's, Hannah, birthday. We collected her from a petrol station out in Meath (Cassie not Hannah). I will never forget how scared Cassie was when we opened the boot of the jeep that she arrived in. She immediately jumped at my sister whinging and scraping Hannah's arms with her little paws. To this day we can't pick Cassie up in our arms and we think it's because of this first traumatic event for her. It was during the car ride back with Mam and Dad that I came up with the name Cassie.</p>

    <p>That first night in her new home Cassie was so confused and scared, not knowing what her new family would be like and how well they will treat her. Little did she know at the time that she got extremely lucky. We setup a brand new bed for her beside the downstairs radiator (to this day that is still her favourite spot in the house, especially when the heat is turned on).</p>
    
    <p>My sister and I couldn't bare to leave Cassie alone that first night as she seemed so scared. So we got our blankets and pillows and slept on the couches to keep her company and hopefully she could begin to realise how much love she was going to receive</p>
    
    <p>And so began 10 years of love, attention, walks, games and barking. I don't regret any second of it. </p>
